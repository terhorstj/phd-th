	Abstract = {Abstract Intermolecular potential functions have been developed for use in computer simulations of alkyl ethers. The simple OPLS model was adopted and parameterized to yield good descriptions of bimolecular and ion-molecule complexes as well as to reproduce experimental thermodynamic properties of liquid ethers. The principal testing featured Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations for liquid dimethyl ether (DME), ethyl methyl ether (EME), diethyl ether (DEE), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Average errors of 1--3\% are obtained for the computed densities and heats of vaporization including results for THF at pressures up to 5000 atm. The torsional motion about the central C---O bonds in EME and DEE was included in the simulations using rotational potential functions fit to results of molecular mechanics (MM2) calculations. The liquid-state environment is found to have negligible effect on the conformational equilibria.},

	Abstract = { As a result of mass screening of the Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical compound library for inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, a novel class of inhibitor, the pyrroles, was identified. Subsequently, a series of analogues was screened for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and some structure-activity relationships were identified. Further characterization of the most potent pyrrole involved comparing its effects in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with its effects in transformed cell lines; the pyrrole had the same efficacy (EC50 = approximately 2 μM) but was less toxic in PBLs (IC50 = 175 μM) than in the cell lines CEM-SS and MT-2 (IC50 = 60-70 μM). The pyrrole was active against a strain of HIV-1 resistant to AZT (strain G9106) but lost activity against both HIV-2 (strain ROD) and a strain of HIV-1 resistant to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (the pyridinone-resistant strain A17). Moreover, in direct enzymatic testing against HIV-1 RT purified from virus particles and against RT expressed recombinantly, the pyrrole showed potent inhibitory activity. We conclude that the pyrroles present a novel class of HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. },

	Abstract = {Abstract How structures fit together is the principal domain of molecular recognition, and current studies are evolving from the host--guest chemistry of ions to interactions between two molecules. Recent advances in the synthesis of sizable concave molecules, especially those featuring convergent functional groups, make it possible to bind smaller convex structures with considerable selectivity. One result is that hydrogen bonding can be addressed in model systems. The present review emphasizes the use of cleftlike structures as a means of probing the forces involved in nucleic acid recognition. The application of such molecules to the catalysis of chemical reactions, particularly those involved in self-replicating systems, is also described. Some implications for future pharmaceutical agents are suggested as a result of access to synthetic receptors for biologically relevant targets.},

The solvent effect on the two conformers are examined in terms of the solvation free energy. Significant stabilization due to solvation was observed on the anti-conformer, while only slight decrease in the free energy is resulted in the syn-conformer. Due to the greater stabilization in the anti-conformer, the energy gap between the two conformers is dramatically reduced in solution; 1.7 kcal/mol in solution compared with 6.9 kcal/mol in gas phase. The change in the electron density of acetic acid upon transferring the solute from gas phase into aqueous solution is visualized to understand the polarization effects due to solvent.},

	Abstract = {Ab initio molecular orbital calculations have been used to construct torsional potential functions for vinyl alcohol and methyl vinyl ether. Full geometry optimization with the split-valence 3--21G basis set has been carried out and improved energy estimates obtained with basis sets up to the size of split-valence plus polarization (6--31G**) and with valence electron correlation incorporated at the levels of second-(MP2) and third-(MP3) order M{\o}ller---Plesset perturbation theory. The most stable rotational isomer of each molecule is found to be the \textit{cis} structure. For vinyl alcohol, the higher-energy conformer has a planar \textit{trans} structure and lies about 7--8 kJ mol--1 above the \textit{cis} form, whereas for methyl vinyl ether, this conformer is predicted to be gauche (with a torsional angle of ∼ 150$\,^{\circ}$) and to lie about 8--9 kJ mol--1 above the \textit{cis} structure. However, the torsional potential function for methyl vinyl ether is found to be very flat in the region 150--180$\,^{\circ}$.bl]},

The ester group exists in 2 planar configurations. The boiling points, dipole moments and rate constants of alkaline hydrolysis of the homologous aliphatic ω-lactones (VII, n = 4--16) show that the ring structure forces VII, n = 4--7 into the energetically rich \textit{cis}-configuration; the members n = 10--16 assume the \textit{trans}-configuration of the open-chain esters, while when n = 8, 9 an equilibrium is adopted. The easy lactone hydrolysis as well as the electrophilic activity of the ω-carbon atom are characteristic of the \textit{cis}-ester structure.},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary
The chapter focuses on a general description of the force fields that are most commonly used at present, and it gives an indication of the directions of current research that may yield better functions in the near future. After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.},

	Abstract = {Most non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are specific for HIV-1 RT and demonstrate minimal inhibition of HIV-2 RT. However, we report that members of the phenylethylthiazolylthiourea (PETT) series of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors showing high potency against HIV-1 RT have varying abilities to inhibit HIV-2 RT. Thus, PETT-1 inhibits HIV-1 RT with an IC50 of 6 nm but shows only weak inhibition of HIV-2 RT, whereas PETT-2 retains similar potency against HIV-1 RT (IC50 of 5 nm) and also inhibits HIV-2 RT (IC50 of 2.2 μm). X-ray crystallographic structure determinations of PETT-1 and PETT-2 in complexes with HIV-1 RT reveal the compounds bind in an overall similar conformation albeit with some differences in their interactions with the protein. To investigate whether PETT-2 could be acting at a different site on HIV-2 RT (e.g. the dNTP or template primer binding site), we compared modes of inhibition for PETT-2 against HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT. PETT-2 was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the dGTP substrate for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs. PETT-2 was also a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to a poly(rC)·(dG) template primer for HIV-2 RT. These results are consistent with PETT-2 binding in corresponding pockets in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT with amino acid sequence differences in HIV-2 RT affecting the binding of PETT-2 compared with PETT-1.},

Target selection, analysis and preparation are discussed, as well as considerations about the compilation of candidate ligand libraries.

	Abstract = {An ab initio (RHF/6-31G*and MP2/6-31G*) study has been undertaken to investigate the spatial structure and relative stability of the acyclic isomers of acetone azine (acetone N-(1-methylethylidene) hydrazone (CH3)2C=N-N=C(CH3)2), differing in the position of multiple bonds, and of the cyclic isomer 3,5,5-trimethyl-4,5-dihydro-$1H$-pyrazole. In the series of structures under study, the latter possesses the greatest thermodynamic stability so that formation of acyclic isomers such as 1-isopropenyl-2-isopropyldiazene, acetone N-isopropenylhydrazone, and 1,2-diisopropenylhydrazine from acetone azine is thermodynamically unfavorable. For each structure, stable conformations have been found, and the internal rotation barriers of molecules relative to the N-N, C-N, and C-C single bonds have been estimated. The noncoplanar goshconformer of acetone azine was found to possess the greatest thermodynamic stability. The acetone azine molecule is considered in comparison with model hydrazine, butadiene, and vinylamine molecules. Acetone azine is conformationally preferable not only because of steric factors, but also due to the interaction of the lone electron pair (LEP) of nitrogen atoms with adjacent N=C multiple bonds.},

	Abstract = {The effect of basis sets on the structures and energetics of the rotation for the peptide bond of $N$-methylacetamide (NMA) has been investigated at high levels of theory. The structures, dipole moments and thermodynamic properties for \textit{trans}- and \textit{cis}-NMA have been determined at the HF, MP2 and B3LYP levels with 6-31G(d), 6-31G(d,p), 6-31+G(d), 6-31+G(d,p), 6-31++G(d,p), 6-311+G(d,p) and 6-311++G(d,p) basis sets. By comparing the calculated structure and dipole moment of \textit{trans}-NMA and the relative enthalpy (ΔH) of \textit{cis}-NMA in the gas phase with corresponding experimental data, the B3LYP level with 6-31G(d) or 6-31G(d,p) basis sets appears to be the most appropriate among several levels of theory and basis sets considered here. \textit{trans}-NMA is computed to be favored by a total free energy of 2.7kcal/mol than \textit{cis}-NMA in water at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level with the SCI-PCM method, which corresponds to 1.1\% population of \textit{cis}-NMA. This is consistent with the results of NMR experiments in aqueous solution that estimate the \textit{cis} population to be 1.5$\pm$0.1\% and the free energy difference of 2.5$\pm$0.3kcal/mol. In addition, the change in relative solvation free energies is computed to be --0.1kcal/mol at the HF and B3LYP levels with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set as transferred from water to chloroform, which corresponds to the increase of the \textit{cis} population by about 0.3\%, consistent with the value from NMR measurements. Therefore, the SCRF method with proper levels of theory and basis sets seems to be reasonable to describe the solvation of NMA. Our calculated results confirmed that the relative distribution of \textit{trans} and \textit{cis} conformers of NMA is insensitive to the solvent polarity.},

	Abstract = {The potential energy surface of $N$-methylacetamide (NMA) is investigated ab initio at the Hartree--Fock/6-31G* level with full geometry optimisation with or without MP2 correlation and thermal corrections in order to characterise its stationary points and the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) of \textit{trans}-\textit{cis} isomerisation. The \textit{cis} and \textit{trans} minima and the two non-equivalent Transition States (TS) of the isomerisation with opposite pyramidalisation of the amidic group are determined. The TS result considerably destablised (∼16 and 21 kcal mol-1) with respect to the most stable equilibrium structure. The lowest energy transition state is the up form (both substituents at N bent toward the carbonyl oxygen), while the down form (with the N lone pair pointing toward the carbonyl oxygen) is higher in energy. A saddle point of index 2 connects the two transition states, ∼8 kcal mol-1 above the TS up, the absence of intermediates being verified. Adding the correlation corrections does not change the energy gaps appreciably. The IRC at HF/6-31G* level has been followed in the most favourable case: correlate deformation of peptide unit and decoupling of methyl groups with respect to the reaction coordinate are shown. Additional TS, depending on methyl groups orientation, confirm the substantial free rotation around the phiv; and $\psi$ torsional angles.},

	Abstract = {We present $^{13}$C dynamic NMR results for relative free energies of equilibrium structures and free energies of activation for conformational transformations of 1,3-dimethylthiourea in aqueous solution, and we compare the results to theoretical predictions. The latter are based on ab initio gas-phase electronic structure calculations of the geometries, dipole moments, and energies combined with semiempirical molecular orbital calculations of the free energies of solvation in three different solvents. The gas-phase electronic structure calculations were performed using M{\o}ller-Plesset second-order (MP2) perturbation theory with a correlation-consistent polarized valence-double-zeta basis set; we calculated relative energies for the three minima Z, Z, E,Z, and E,E and for three transition states on the potential energy surface. The solvation energy calculations were carried out using the SM5.4/AM1-aqueous, -chloroform, and -organic solvation models; these solvation models are based on semiempirical molecular orbital theory with class-IV charges and geometry-based first-solvation-shell effects. The relative energies of the conformers and transition states are compared to experiment in water and five organic solvents.},

The latter two basis sets yield geometries in best agreement with experimental data. Calculated energy barriers for rotation about the CN bond become progressively higher as the basis set is enlarged; electron correlation leads to a modest reduction. At the MP2/6-31G*//6-31G* level, the barriers lie in the range of 80--90 kJ mol--1. Alkyl substitution on either end of the carbamate group increases the +C=O-- charge separation. N-substitution reduces the electron density on the nitrogen whereas the negative charge of this atom is increased by esterification of carbamic acid.},

	Abstract = {In a non-redundant set of 571 proteins from the Brookhaven Protein Data Base, a total of 43 non-proline \textit{cis} peptide bonds were identified. Average geometrical parameters of the well-defined \textit{cis} peptide bonds in proteins determined at high resolution show that some parameters, most notably the bond angle at the amide bond nitrogen, deviate significantly from the corresponding one in the \textit{trans} conformation. Since the same feature was observed in \textit{cis} amide bonds in small molecule structures found in the Cambridge Structural Data Base, a new set of parameters for the refinement of protein structures containing non-Pro \textit{cis} peptide bonds is proposed. A striking preference was observed for main-chain dihedral angles of the residues involved in \textit{cis} peptide bonds. All residues N-terminal and most residues C-terminal to a non-Pro \textit{cis} peptide bond (except Gly) are located in the β-region of a φ/ψ plot. Also, all of the few C-terminal residues (except Gly) located in the α-region of the φ/ψ plot constitute the start of an α-helix in the respective structure. In the majority of cases, an intimate side-chain/side-chain interaction was observed between the flanking residues, often involving aromatic side-chains. Interestingly, most of the cases found occur in functionally important regions such as close to the active site of proteins. It is intriguing that many of the proteins containing non-proline \textit{cis} peptide bonds are carbohydrate-binding or processing proteins. The occurrence of these unusual peptide bonds is significantly more frequent in structures determined at high resolution than in structures determined at medium and low resolution, suggesting that these bonds may be more abundant than previously thought. On the basis of our experience with the structure determination of coagulation factor XIII, we developed an algorithm for the identification of possibly overlooked \textit{cis} peptide bonds that exploits the deviations of geometrical parameters from ideality. A few likely candidates based on our algorithm have been identified and are discussed.},

@article{guvench,
	Abstract = {Abstract The generalized Born/surface area (GB/SA) continuum model for solvation free energy is a fast and accurate alternative to using discrete water molecules in molecular simulations of solvated systems. However, computational studies of large solvated molecular systems such as enzyme--ligand complexes can still be computationally expensive even with continuum solvation methods simply because of the large number of atoms in the solute molecules. Because in such systems often only a relatively small portion of the system such as the ligand binding site is under study, it becomes less attractive to calculate energies and derivatives for all atoms in the system. To curtail computation while still maintaining high energetic accuracy, atoms distant from the site of interest are often frozen; that is, their coordinates are made invariant. Such frozen atoms do not require energetic and derivative updates during the course of a simulation. Herein we describe methodology and results for applying the frozen atom approach to both the generalized Born (GB) and the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) parts of the GB/SA continuum model for solvation free energy. For strictly pairwise energetic terms, such as the Coulombic and van-der-Waals energies, contributions from pairs of frozen atoms can be ignored. This leaves energetic differences unaffected for conformations that vary only in the positions of nonfrozen atoms. Due to the nonlocal nature of the GB analytical form, however, excluding such pairs from a GB calculation leads to unacceptable inaccuracies. To apply a frozen-atom scheme to GB calculations, a buffer region within the frozen-atom zone is generated based on a user-definable cutoff distance from the nonfrozen atoms. Certain pairwise interactions between frozen atoms in the buffer region are retained in the GB computation. This allows high accuracy in conformational GB comparisons to be maintained while achieving significant savings in computational time compared to the full (nonfrozen) calculation. A similar approach for using a buffer region of frozen atoms is taken for the SASA calculation. The SASA calculation is local in nature, and thus exact SASA energies are maintained. With a buffer region of 8 {\AA} for the frozen-atom cases, excellent agreement in differences in energies for three different conformations of cytochrome P450 with a bound camphor ligand are obtained with respect to the nonfrozen cases. For various minimization protocols, simulations run 2 to 10.5 times faster and memory usage is reduced by a factor of 1.5 to 5. Application of the frozen atom method for GB/SA calculations thus can render computationally tractable biologically and medically important simulations such as those used to study ligand--receptor binding conformations and energies in a solvated environment. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {Abstract Solvent effects play a crucial role in mediating the interactions between proteins and their ligands. Implicit solvent models offer some advantages for modeling these interactions, but they have not been parameterized on such complex problems, and therefore, it is not clear how reliable they are. We have studied the binding of an octapeptide ligand to the murine MHC class I protein using both explicit solvent and implicit solvent models. The solvation free energy calculations are more than 103 faster using the Surface Generalized Born implicit solvent model compared to FEP simulations with explicit solvent. For some of the electrostatic calculations needed to estimate the binding free energy, there is near quantitative agreement between the explicit and implicit solvent model results; overall, the qualitative trends in the binding predicted by the explicit solvent FEP simulations are reproduced by the implicit solvent model. With an appropriate choice of reference system based on the binding of the discharged ligand, electrostatic interactions are found to enhance the binding affinity because the favorable Coulomb interaction energy between the ligand and protein more than compensates for the unfavorable free energy cost of partially desolvating the ligand upon binding. Some of the effects of protein flexibility and thermal motions on charging the peptide in the solvated complex are also considered. {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	Abstract = {Abstract The development and parameterization of a solvent potential of mean force designed to reproduce the hydration thermodynamics of small molecules and macromolecules aimed toward applications in conformation prediction and ligand binding free energy prediction is presented. The model, named SGB/NP, is based on a parameterization of the Surface Generalized Born continuum dielectric electrostatic model using explicit solvent free energy perturbation calculations and a newly developed nonpolar hydration free energy estimator motivated by the results of explicit solvent simulations of the thermodynamics of hydration of hydrocarbons. The nonpolar model contains, in addition to the more commonly used solvent accessible surface area term, a component corresponding to the attractive solute--solvent interactions. This term is found to be important to improve the accuracy of the model, particularly for cyclic and hydrogen bonding compounds. The model is parameterized against the experimental hydration free energies of a set of small organic molecules. The model reproduces the experimental hydration free energies of small organic molecules with an accuracy comparable or superior to similar models employing more computationally demanding estimators and/or a more extensive set of parameters. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {Abstract The docking of flexible small molecule ligands to large flexible protein targets is addressed in this article using a two-stage simulation-based method. The methodology presented is a hybrid approach where the first component is a dock of the ligand to the protein binding site, based on deriving sets of simultaneously satisfied intermolecular hydrogen bonds using graph theory and a recursive distance geometry algorithm. The output structures are reduced in number by cluster analysis based on distance similarities. These structures are submitted to a modified Monte Carlo algorithm using the AMBER-AA molecular mechanics force field with the Generalized Born/Surface Area (GB/SA) continuum model. This solvent model is not only less expensive than an explicit representation, but also yields increased sampling. Sampling is also increased using a rotamer library to direct some of the protein side-chain movements along with large dihedral moves. Finally, a softening function for the nonbonded force field terms is used, enabling the potential energy function to be slowly turned on throughout the course of the simulation. The docking procedure is optimized, and the results are presented for a single complex of the arabinose binding protein. It was found that for a rigid receptor model, the X-ray binding geometry was reproduced and uniquely identified based on the associated potential energy. However, when side-chain flexibility was included, although the X-ray structure was identified, it was one of three possible binding geometries that were energetically indistinguishable. These results suggest that on relaxing the constraint on receptor flexibility, the docking energy hypersurface changes from being funnel-like to rugged. A further 14 complexes were then examined using the optimized protocol. For each complex the docking methodology was tested for a fully flexible ligand, both with and without protein side-chain flexibility. For the rigid protein docking, 13 out of the 15 test cases were able to find the experimental binding mode; this number was reduced to 11 for the flexible protein docking. However, of these 11, in the majority of cases the experimental binding mode was not uniquely identified, but was present in a cluster of low energy structures that were energetically indistinguishable. These results not only support the presence of a rugged docking energy hypersurface, but also suggest that it may be necessary to consider the possibility of more than one binding conformation during ligand optimization. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {Abstract We have studied the potential of mean force of two peptides, one known to adopt a \textbeta-hairpin and the other an \textalpha-helical conformation in solution. These peptides are, respectively, residues 41--56 of the C-terminus (GEWTYDDATKTFTVTE) of the B1 domain of protein G and the 13 residue C-peptide (KETAAAKFERQHM) of ribonuclease A. Extensive canonical ensemble sampling has been performed using a parallel replica exchange method. The effective potential employed in this work consists of the OPLS all-atom force field (OPLS-AA) and an analytical generalized Born (AGB) implicit solvent model including a novel nonpolar solvation free energy estimator (NP). An additional dielectric screening parameter has been incorporated into the AGBNP model. In the case of the \textbeta-hairpin, the nonpolar solvation free energy estimator provides the necessary effective interactions for the collapse of the hydrophobic core (W43, Y45, F52, and V54), which the more commonly used surface-area-dependent nonpolar model does not provide. For both the \textbeta-hairpin and the \textalpha-helix, increased dielectric screening reduces the stability of incorrectly formed salt bridges, which tend to disrupt the formation of the hairpin and helix, respectively. The fraction of \textbeta-hairpin and \textalpha-helix content we obtained using the AGBNP model agrees well with experimental results. The thermodynamic stability of the \textbeta-hairpin from protein G and the \textalpha-helical C-peptide from ribonuclease A as modeled with the OPLS-AA/AGBNP effective potential reflects the balance between the nonpolar effective potential terms, which drive compaction, and the polar and hydrogen bonding terms, which promote secondary structure formation.

	Abstract = {Simulations of an RNA hairpin containing a GNRA tetraloop were conducted to allow the characterization of its secondary structure formation and dynamics. Ten 10 ns trajectories of the folded hairpin 5′-GGGC[GCAA]GCCU-3′ were generated using stochastic dynamics and the GB/SA implicit solvent model at 300 K. Overall, we find the stem to be a very stable subunit of this molecule, whereas multiple loop conformations and transitions between them were observed. These trajectories strongly suggest that extension of the C6 base away from the loop occurs cooperatively with an N-type→S-type sugar pucker conversion in that residue and that similar pucker transitions are necessary to stabilize other looped-out bases. In addition, a short-lived conformer with an extended fourth loop residue (A8) lacking this stabilizing 2′-endo pucker mode was observed. Results of thermal perturbation at 400 K support this model of loop dynamics. Unfolding trajectories were produced using this same methodology at temperatures of 500 to 700 K. The observed unfolding events display three-state behavior kinetically (including native, globular, and unfolded populations) and, based on these observations, we propose a folding mechanism that consists of three distinct events: (i) collapse of the random unfolded structure and sampling of the globular state; (ii) passage into the folded region of configurational space as stem base-pairs form and gain helicity; and (iii) attainment of proper loop geometry and organization of loop pairing and stacking interactions. These results are considered in the context of current experimental knowledge of this and similar nucleic acid hairpins.},

	Abstract = { ▪ Abstract It would often be useful in computer simulations to use a simple description of solvation effects, instead of explicitly representing the individual solvent molecules. Continuum dielectric models often work well in describing the thermodynamic aspects of aqueous solvation, and approximations to such models that avoid the need to solve the Poisson equation are attractive because of their computational efficiency. Here we give an overview of one such approximation, the generalized Born model, which is simple and fast enough to be used for molecular dynamics simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. We discuss its strengths and weaknesses, both for its fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for its ability to replace explicit consideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations. We focus particularly on versions of the generalized Born model that have a pair-wise analytical form, and therefore fit most naturally into conventional molecular mechanics calculations. },

	Abstract = {This work presents a Generalized Born model for the computation of the electrostatic component of solvation energies which is based on volume integration. An analytic masking function is introduced to remove Coulombic singularities. This approach leads to analytic formulae for the computation of Born radii{,} which are differentiable to arbitrary order{,} and computationally straightforward to implement.},
